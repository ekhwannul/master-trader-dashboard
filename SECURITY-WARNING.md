# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING - URGENT!

## 🚨 REPO IS PUBLIC!

Your repo is now public: https://github.com/wanoi90/master-trader-dashboard.git

## ✅ Good News:
- .env file NOT committed (protected by .gitignore)
- API keys NOT exposed in GitHub

## ⚠️ Action Required:

### 1. Regenerate Bybit API Keys (RECOMMENDED)
Even though .env not committed, better safe than sorry:

1. Go to Bybit: https://www.bybit.com/app/user/api-management
2. Delete old API key: `DBNpBkw5SswjQuR63B`
3. Create new API key
4. Update .env file dengan new keys
5. Update environment variables di Vercel/Railway

### 2. Make Repo Private (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Go to GitHub repo settings
# Change visibility to Private
```

Or keep public but:
- ✅ .env is in .gitignore (already done)
- ✅ Never commit API keys
- ✅ Use environment variables in deployment

---
